    "# Molecular design ML-in-the-loop workflow with Parsl\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates a simple molecular design application where we use machine learning to guide which computations we perform.\n",
    "The objective of this application is to identify which molecules have the largest ionization energies (IE, the amount of energy required to remove an electron). \n",
    "\n",
    "IE can be computed using various simulation packages (here we use [xTB](https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html) ); however, execution of these simulations is expensive, and thus, given a finite compute budget, we must carefully select which molecules to explore. We use machine learning to predict high IE molecules based on previous computations (a process often called [active learning](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c00768)). We iteratively retrain the machine learning model to improve the accuracy of predictions. The resulting ML-in-the-loop workflow proceeds as follows. \n",

Parsl allows us to establish dependencies in the workflow and to execute the workflow on arbitrary computing infrastructure, from laptops to supercomputers. We show how Parsl's integration with Python's native concurrency library (i.e., [`concurrent.futures`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures)) let you write applications that dynamically respond to the completion of asynchronous tasks."

    "To start, let's make a function that uses our prior simulations to train a model. We are going to use RDKit and scikit-learn to train a nearest-neighbor model that uses Morgan fingerprints to define similarity (see [notes from a UChicago AI course](https://github.com/WardLT/applied-ai-for-materials/blob/main/molecular-property-prediction/chemoinformatics/2_ml-with-fingerprints.ipynb) for more detail). In short, the function trains a model that first populates a list of certain substructures (Morgan fingerprints, specifically) and then trains a model which predicts the IE of a new molecule by averaging those with the most similar substructures.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use Parsl here to scale the model and to later combine it into our ML-in-the-loop workflow. To do so, we define the function using `python_app`. This time, `python_app` is used as a decorator directly on the function definition (earlier we defined a regular function, and then applied `python_app` afterwards)."
